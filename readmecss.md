# Task 2 – Styling the Profile Page Using CSS Box Model

## Overview
This task focuses on styling a semantic HTML profile page using an external
CSS file and applying CSS box model concepts.

## What I Did
- Created a separate `style.css` file and linked it to the HTML document.
- Applied global styles such as font family, background color, and text color.
- Used **padding, margin, and borders** to clearly demonstrate the CSS box model.
- Styled headers, lists, and sections to improve visual hierarchy.
- Implemented **class-based styling** for scalability and clean structure.
- Refactored repeated styles into reusable CSS classes like `.section-box`.

## Outcome
A visually structured and readable profile page that clearly demonstrates
understanding of the CSS box model and layout spacing.
